/**
 * \brief UTF-8 is a way of reading and writing Unicode 32-bit characters
 *  to ordinary 8-bit communications streams.
 *
 *  The UTF-8 algorithm stores characters into variable-sized
 *  chunks. Characters in the range 0x00 to 0x7F fit into one
 *  byte, since these will be quite common (ASCII values).
 *  Characters with higher values fit into two, three, four,
 *  five, or six bytes, depending on the number of significant
 *  bits, according to the following pattern:
 *
 *  Bits  Pattern
 *  ----  -------
 *    7   0xxxxxxx
 *   11   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
 *   16   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 *   21   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 *   26   111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 *   32   111111xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
 *
 *  As can be seen from the table, at most 32 bits can be stored
 *  using this algorithm (the x's mark where the actual bits go,
 *  the numbers signify the padding bits). The padding "10" at
 *  the start of a byte uniquely identifies a continuation byte,
 *  which is never used as the start of a UTF-8 character sequence,
 *  so if a stream is broken for some reason, the algorithm can
 *  skip those bytes to find the next start of a character.
 *
 *  ASCII is a 7-bit encoding for the English language alphabet
 *  and various digits and symbols. Its values range from 0x00 to 0x7F.
 *
 *  A superset of ASCII is ISO-Latin-1 (code page 8859-1). This is
 *  an 8-bit encoding for Western European languages, with values
 *  in the range 0x00 to 0xFF. The lower half of this range is
 *  the same as ASCII, while the upper half includes many accented
 *  characters.
 *
 *  Unicode is a superset of ISO-Latin-1, which mostly fits into
 *  16-bits, but which is actually a 32-bit encoding for most
 *  language symbols on Earth, including Eastern European, African,
 *  Asian, and many other languages. It allows a single document
 *  to contain mixtures of all languages.
 *
 *  This file contains functions for reading and writing Unicode
 *  and ISO-Latin-1 streams, to and from an array of 32-bit
 *  Unicode values in memory. Each 32-bit value is called a Char.
